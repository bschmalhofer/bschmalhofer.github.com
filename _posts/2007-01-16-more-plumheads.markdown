Lately I have expanded the scope of <b>P</b>lum<b>H</b>eaded <b>P</b>arakeet. The current plan is to have a side-by-side comparison of differend parsing and transformation techniques. These techniques are:
<dl>
  <dt>PHC</dt>
  <dd>Take XML output of phc, <a href="http://phpcompiler.org/" rel="nofollow">http://phpcompiler.org/</a>, and transform it with XSLT.</dd><dt>ANTLR3</dt><dd>Write parser and treegrammar in ANTLR3, <a href="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/" rel="nofollow">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/</a>, with Java backend</dd><dt>Partridge</dt><dd>Use the Parrot compiler tools for parsing and transformation</dd></dl>

The transformation target is in all three PAST-pm,
an abstract syntax tree that can be trasformed into Parrot bytecode.
