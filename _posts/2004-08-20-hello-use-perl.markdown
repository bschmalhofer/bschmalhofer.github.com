title: Hello use Perl;
---

Since the last year I found myself checking [use Perl;](http://use.perl.org/)
and clicking a couple of _Recent Journal_'s almost daily.
Starting from that I'll try writing in my journal.
The plan is to do a regular entry every two weeks.

So that's it for self motivation.

Now to my introduction.

I'm a 34 year old trained physicist, now doing software development and custumer support.
Mostly I'm doing web application stuff for a Bioinformatics portal.

On the geeky side, I try to contribute to Parrot. I'm maintaining a halfway finished implementation
of m4 in PIR. Currently I'm playing around with bringing YAML to Parrot.
The long term vision is to do a implemention of JavaScript.

Yesterday a social meeting of the [Munich Perl Mongers](http://munich.pm.org/) took place.
Lively discussions were ranging from quantum dots to the state of documention of the Kwiki framework.
