title: Welcoming Pipp
---

<p>
The PHP on Parrot implementation used to be called Plumhead, after the Plum-Headed Parakeet. As this name is somewhat goofy, a new name was sought. Some more or less sane variants were discussed, <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/parrot/index.cgi?plumhead_renaming" rel="nofollow">http://www.perlfoundation.org/parrot/index.cgi?plumhead_renaming</a>.

And the winner is <b>Pipp</b>.

Thanks to Christoph Otto for getting this rolling.
