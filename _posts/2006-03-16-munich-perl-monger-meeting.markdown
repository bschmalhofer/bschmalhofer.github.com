title: Munich Perl Monger meeting
---

In a radical breach of tradition, the Munich Perl Mongers decided to have regular bimonthly meetings. In order to limit the culture shock, the location will remain dynamic and will be chosen in feverish indecision.

So yesterday evening was the first regular meeting.
Five Mongers showed, including a new face, Gertraud.
Harald J&#246;rg has a writeup in German, <a href="http://munich.pm.org/2006-03-15.html" rel="nofollow">http://munich.pm.org/2006-03-15.html</a>. Topics ranged from using 'ed' on appliances to the job prospects of assembler programmers for BS2000.

The MPM schedule is the third wednesday of uneven months. When in doubt consult the perlgolf entries in <a href="http://munich.pm.org/perlgolf.html" rel="nofollow">http://munich.pm.org/perlgolf.html</a>.

On the Parrot side, I hope to teach ANTLR 3 more about bc. And coming saturday I plan to attend the
'Linux Info Tag' in Augsburg, enjoying Ingo Blechschmidt's talk 'Perl6 genau jetzt'.
