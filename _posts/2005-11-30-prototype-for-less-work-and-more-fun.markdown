title: Prototype for less work and more fun
---

At $WORK I'm still doling away at my Mason-powered
webapp, that keeps track of interesting biological sequences.

Lately I have been AJAXifying things with the help of Prototype, <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/" rel="nofollow">http://prototype.conio.net/</a>.
This works out quite nicely. For the user it makes
the interaction more fluent. For the programming part, I experienced that it makes the seperation of content and actions more natural. I have to admit though, that I have no proper MVC setup yet.

For effects I use <a href="http://script.aculo.us/" rel="nofollow">http://script.aculo.us/</a>. I'm quite fond of the autocompleter. I use it to let the user choose for the NCBI taxonomy database
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=taxonomy" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=taxonomy</a>

The next think to look for is a consistent set of widgets, preferably based on Prototype. Perhaps Rico, <a href="http://openrico.org/" rel="nofollow">http://openrico.org/</a>
