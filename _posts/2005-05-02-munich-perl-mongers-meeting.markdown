title: Munich Perl Mongers meeting
---

Last Thursday we had our semi regular meeting of the Munich Perl Mongers. Eight brave souls tourned up at the Hirschgarten, http://www.hirschgarten.de/.
Unexpectedly we had sunshine and thus could sit outside in the quite beautiful beergarden.

Topics ranged from mod_survey to Perl scripts for verifying orders in a large print shop.

Ralph Leonhard was interested in R on Parrot, but lacks time and funds. He mentioned that R is based on an internal scheme engine. So I started to look
at languages/scheme in the Parrot SVN.
