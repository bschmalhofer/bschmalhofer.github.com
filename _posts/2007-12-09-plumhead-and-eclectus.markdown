title: Plumhead and Eclectus
---

I'm inching forward with Plumhead, PHP on Parrot,
and Eclectus, Scheme on Parrot.

Both have been converted to use the shiny new Parrot Compiler Toolkit. I don't use NQP yet, but being able to use Perl6 for compiler and library implementation is sooo sweet. Kudos to Patrick Michaud.

On the Plumhead side, Jeff Horwitz did some brave hacking and added Plumhead to mod_parrot. See <a href="http://www.smashing.org/jeff/node/24" rel="nofollow">http://www.smashing.org/jeff/node/24</a>
