title: Pipp has left the nest and moved to github
---

Pipp, that is PHP on Parrot, has moved to github, <a href="http://github.com/bschmalhofer/pipp/" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/bschmalhofer/pipp/</a>.

I have not yet tested with an installed Parrot yet. So for now please check out Pipp in a Parrot source dir. See <a href="http://wiki.github.com/bschmalhofer/pipp" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.github.com/bschmalhofer/pipp</a> for details.

If you want to play with a cooler language than PHP, then take a look at <a href="https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/Languages" rel="nofollow">https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/Languages</a>.
