title: HQ9+ left the nest
---

HQ9+, <a href="http://www.esolangs.org/wiki/HQ9_Plus" rel="nofollow">http://www.esolangs.org/wiki/HQ9_Plus</a>, is a little language the makes a few things easy, and almost all other things impossible.

There is an implementation of HQ9+ for Parrot that is based on the Parrot Compiler Toolkit. For getting my feet wet with git, it moved the source code from Parrot's svn repository to <a href="http://github.com/bschmalhofer/hq9plus/tree/master" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/bschmalhofer/hq9plus/tree/master</a>.
The migration went very smoothly and git made a good initial impression on me. The instructions on github.com were very helpful. Details on the migration are on <a href="https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/LeaveTheNest" rel="nofollow">https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/LeaveTheNest</a>.

In this migration I simply discarded the svn commit history. For moving other languages to git, it would be handy to have a complete and current git mirror of Parrot's svn repository.
