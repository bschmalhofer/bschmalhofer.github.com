title: MIME::Base64
---

After starting on Plumhead, aka *P*lum*H*eaded *P*arakeet, I stumbled on base64 encoded strings
embedded in the XML emitted by [phc](http://phpcompiler.org/).

The plan is to create Parrot Intermediate Representation from XML.
So I became sidetracked into making a MIME::Base64 module for PIR.
As usual it took longer than expected, even though I found a
[nice German tutorial](http://aktuell.de.selfhtml.org/artikel/javascript/utf8b64/base64.htm).
So an incomplete implementation is now at <a href="http://svn.perl.org/viewcvs/parrot/trunk/runtime/parrot/library/MIME/Base64.pir" rel="nofollow">http://svn.perl.org/viewcvs/parrot/trunk/runtime/parrot/library/MIME/Base64.pir</a>.

The tests I stole from the Perl5 module MIME::Base64.
Thanks to Will Coleda for compilers/json, which helps in setting up the test cases.
