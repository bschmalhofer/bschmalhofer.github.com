title: Parrot 0.6.4
---

On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 0.6.4
&quot;St. Vincent Amazon.&quot;.
[Parrot](http://parrotcode.org/) is a virtual machine
aimed at running dynamic languages.

Parrot 0.6.4 is available via [CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/dist/parrot)
(soon), or [follow the download instructions](http://parrotcode.org/source.html).
For those who would like to develop on Parrot, or help
develop Parrot itself, we recommend using [Subersion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) on
[our source code repository](https://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/) to get the latest
and best Parrot code.
