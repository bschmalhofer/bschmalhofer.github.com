title: Teaching myself Scheme
---

In the last weeks I have been neglecting Plumhead, that is PHP on Parrot.
Instead I have been concentrating on learning about Common Lisp and Scheme.
Currently I'm working my way through a nice Scheme tutorial, <cite>Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days</cite> <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dorai/t-y-scheme/t-y-scheme.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dorai/t-y-scheme/t-y-scheme.html</a>.
I try to make the tutorial examples work in 'languages/scheme', a Scheme on Parrot implementation from Jeff Goff.

I also got me a copy of <cite>Lisp in small pieces</cite>. But I found that it's better to know a little bit of Scheme, before starting to delve into that.
