title: Plum-headed Parakeet
---

Mark Overmeer passed on one of the take home messages from YAPC::Europe in
Birmingham. In a lightening talk about XML::Compile,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~markov/XML-Compile/" rel="nofollow">http://search.cpan.org/~markov/XML-Compile/</a>, he said something like:
<cite>Never mind the XML, it's just syntax.</cite>
The day before, Allison Randall had talked about the Parrot compiler tools
and mentioned how XSLT had influenced the design of TGE.
So I wondered whether <cite>Never mind the XSLT, it's just syntax.</cite> applies as well.

The XSLT project I came up with, is to take the XML output of phc, <a href="http://phpcompiler.org/" rel="nofollow">http://phpcompiler.org/</a> and transform it to
something Parrot can understand. phc parses PHP, so this should become an implementation
of PHP on Parrot.

As a projectname, <a href="http://svn.perl.org/viewcvs/parrot/trunk/languages/plumhead/" rel="nofollow">http://svn.perl.org/viewcvs/parrot/trunk/languages/plumhead/</a>,
I chose 'Plumhead', which is short for <b>P</b>lum-<b>h</b>eaded <b>P</b>arakeet, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum-headed_parakeet" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum-headed_parakeet</a>.
The description on Wikipedia is neat too:
<cite>Plum-headed Parakeet is a gregarious and noisy species with range of raucous calls.</cite>
