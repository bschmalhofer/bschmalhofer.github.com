title: Moved Unlambda and Lazy K to github
---

[Unlambda](http://www.madore.org/~david/programs/unlambda/) and [Lazy K](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Lazy_K") 
are two pure functional esoteric programming languages. Leo TÃ¶tsch implemented them for Parrot.
As language implementation are encouraged to leave the nest, I moved them over to
[Github](http://github.com/bschmalhofer).

See <a href="https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/Languages" rel="nofollow">https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/Languages</a>
for the current list of languages for Parrot.
