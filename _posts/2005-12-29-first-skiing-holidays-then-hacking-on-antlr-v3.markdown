title: First skiing holidays, then hacking on ANTLR v3
---

<p>
For tomorrow I'm planning a quiet day at $work and on Saturday me and Regina are heading for a week a skiing in the Wildsch&#246;nau, in the Austrian Alps. I'm looking forward to that, as there has been ample snowfall in the Mountains. I won't take my notebook, only my copy of 'Language Programming Pragmatics' for light reading.
</p><p>
After the holiday I really plan to get going on a Parrot backend of ANTLR v3. I'm not sure about the target language yet. I might start with PIR and then try to learn more about the 'PIL2 minilanguage'.
</p><p>
WRT to 'Parrot bc' I'll continue to piggyback on 'punie'. So I try to generate 'Allison's PAST' from bc, for whatever features are implemented for punie.
</p><p>
At $work I have been looking at <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/" rel="nofollow">http://www.openqa.org/selenium/</a>. This looks like exactly like the thing I want for web testing. It might also make the colleagues in quallity assurance happy!
The only thing I'm really missing is support for frames. But some smart Ruby guys are already working on it.
