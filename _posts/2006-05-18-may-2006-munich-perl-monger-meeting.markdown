title: May 2006 Munich Perl Monger meeting
---

<p>
Last night the Munich Perl Mongers celebrated the
second installment of the bimonthly meeting. Harald J&#246;rg, the MPM fearless leader, suggested a 'Man Fat,
a chinese restaurant in Schwabing as the stomping ground.
The food was tasty and the wheatbeer was most welcome after the bike ride from $work at the other end of town.

Besides 7 regulars, two new faces showed up: another J&#246;rg, of Perl golf fame, and Susanne Ruppel. Susanne got the rocks rolling by suggesting to bid for the German Perl Workshop 2007. As the enthusiasm is there, it was decided to go for it! In 2002, when we hosted the YAPC::EU, only Norbert Gr&#252;ner really knew what we were getting into. This time we have no excuses.
