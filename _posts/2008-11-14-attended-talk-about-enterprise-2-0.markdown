title: Attended talk about Enterprise 2.0
---

Wednesday night I attended a talk entitled "Enterprise 2.0 &#8211; Die Kunst, loszulassen".
I didn't expect much of the talk, as I primarily
went there for meeting people. But I was pleasently
surprised, as the speaker Wilms Buhse did an excellent talk. He really made his point, that the lessons learned from social networks can be applied to enterprises. His examples were the experiences at CoreMedia and with http://www.dnadigital.de/.

The other thing I learned at the Forum is that Dresden is really a nice City. I just didn't find the sweet spots when I went there.
