title: Introducing Eclectus
---

<p>
When working on 'languages/scheme' in the Parrot repository I got estranged with using Perl5 for
implementing Scheme on Parrot. It sure does the
job, but I want to learn about Lisp, not about
Arrays of Arrays in Perl 5.
</p><p>
I came across <i>An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction</i> at <a href="http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf</a>.
This is a Scheme to x86 assembly compiler, implemented in Scheme. The cute thing is that the compiler construction is done in small steps. Every step constitutes a working compiler for a larger subset of Scheme.
So I stared to work on Eclectus, a bootrapping Scheme to PBC compiler.
