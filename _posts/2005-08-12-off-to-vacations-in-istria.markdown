This afternoon I'm heading with Regina down South to Istria. We are staying in an appartment in lovely Rovinj, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=45.075945,13.642187&amp;spn=0.025854,0.059524&amp;t=h&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=45.075945,13.642187&amp;spn=0.025854,0.059524&amp;t=h&amp;hl<nobr>=<wbr></nobr> en</a>.

Tonight we propably stay overnight in the Austrian Alps. If we are lucky, we will glimps some meteorites from Perseids meteorite shower.

I don't know if I have Internet access in Rovinj. My notebook is packed. I've also downloaded the 'bc' and 'm4' specs and might work a little on their respective Parrot ports.
