title: Hello use Perl;

<p>
Since the last year I found myself checking 'use Perl;' and clicking a couple of 'Recent Journal's' almost daily. Starting from that I'll try writing in my journal. The plan is to do a regular entry every two weeks.

So that's it for self motivation.

Now to my introduction.
</p><p>
I'm a 34 year old trained physicist, now doing software development and custumer support. Mostly I'm doing web application stuff for a Bioinformatics portal.

On the geeky side, I try to contribute to Parrot. I'm maintaining a halfway finished implementation of m4 in PIR. Currently I'm playing around with bringing YAML to Parrot. The long term vision is to do a implemention of JavaScript.

Yesterday a social meeting of the Munich Perl Mongers took place. Lively discussions were ranging from quantum dots to the state of documention of the Kwiki framework.
